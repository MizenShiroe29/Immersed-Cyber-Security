# Immersed-Cyber-Security
Web-based immersive cyber security training platform designed to engage all ages while providing educators/administrators robust controls to tailor
training content for any user. Immersed is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .Net, and React code for the File upload and Contact Us Features.
